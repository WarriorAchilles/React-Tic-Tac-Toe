# React Tic Tac Toe - Updates

Welcome to the updates branch! This branch contains my updates to the ReactJs Tic Tac Toe [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) project. In the [wrapping up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) section of the tutorial, they listed a few extra challenges to do to practice your react skills. In this branch I've completed those challenges as well as styled the game with bootstrap. The main functionality remains the same and running the project with `npm start` and all the other npm commands remain unchanged.
